# CoreEngine

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started with writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders by default:

- `src`: The folder to maintain source code.
- `lib`: The folder to maintain dependencies.
- `build`: The folder where compiled output files are generated by default.
- `dist`: The executable version of the project

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view in VS Code allows you to manage your dependencies easily. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Documentation

For detailed information about the project architecture, components, and usage, please refer to the [Docs.md](Overview.md) file.
